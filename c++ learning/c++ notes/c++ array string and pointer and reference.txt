Array::an array as a set of elements of same data type stored linearly at contigous memory locations.
we use array when we want to store many variable then we make a array of these element due to which it is easily accesible.
Array declaration::
1)Array declaration by specifying size::
int n=10;
int a[n];
2)Array declaration by initializing elements::
int a[]={10,20, 30,40,50};
3)Array declaration by specifying size and initializing elements:
int a[5]={10,20,30,40,50};
Some fact about array in c++:
1) array element is accesible by indexing.
2)
No Index Out of bound Checking: There is no index out of bound checking in C/C++, for example the following program compiles fine but may produce unexpected output when run.
3)it will store the data in a continuous memory location.
