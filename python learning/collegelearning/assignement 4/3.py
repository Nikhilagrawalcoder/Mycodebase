'''Bottle Necks Problem
ïƒ˜ Problem Description
There are N bottles. ith bottle has A[i] radius. Once a bottle is enclosed inside another
bottle, it ceases to be visible. Minimize the number of visible bottles.
You can put ith bottle into jth bottle if following condition is fulfilled:
1) ith bottle itself is not enclosed in another bottle.
2) jth bottle does not enclose any other bottle.
3) Radius of bottle i is smaller than bottle j (i.e. A[i] < A[j]).
Constraints 
1 <= N <= 100000.
1 <= A[i] <= 10^18.
Input Format
First line contains a single integer N denoting the number of bottles.
Second line contains N space separated integers, ith integer denoting the radius of Ith 
bottle.
(1 <= i <= N). 
Output 
Minimum number of visible bottles. 
Test Case
Explanation 
Example 1
Input
8
1 1 2 3 4 5 5 4
Output
2
Explanation
1st bottle can be kept in 3 rd one 1-->2 , which makes following bottles visible [1,2,3,4,5,5,4]
similarly after following operations, the following will be the corresponding visible bottles
Operation ? Visible Bottles
2 ? 3 [1,3,4,5,5,4]
3 ? 4 [1,4,5,5,4]
4 ? 5 [1,5,5,4]
1 ? 4 [5,5,4]
4 ? 5 [5,5]
finally there are 2 bottles which are visible. Hence, the answer is 2
